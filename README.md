## Introduction

**octARTE** is intended to be an **ARTE** adaptation to **GNU Octave**. The original project was designed to be compatible with **Matlab**, and although Octave is mostly Matlab compatible, this project was created with the intention to achieve total Octave compatibility.

The original **ARTE** library was released under the **LGPL** license, but **octARTE** is released under the terms of the **GPL** license (this modification is allowed by LGPL).

## Credits

The original **ARTE** library was created by **Arturo Gil Aparicio**, and as of 17/10/15 its source can be found here: https://github.com/4rtur1t0/ARTE
